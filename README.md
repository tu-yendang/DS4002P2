# DS4002P2
Data Science Capstone Project 2 - The Best of Both Worlds: Former Disney Stars Turned Musicians

## Section 1: Software and Platform
* The primary software used for this project was Python, specifically using Interactive Python Notebook files (ipynb). These files were created and used with Google Colab. Additionally, data was read in as JSON files and were processed to be CSV files.
* The following packages were used:
    * json - read and manipulate JSON files
    * csv - read, write and manipulate CSV files
    * datetime - input standardized date format for data
* Three laptops were used, where two devices used Mac, while one was conducted on Windows.
